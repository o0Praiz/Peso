# Peso Project Overview

## Project Goals
The Peso Project aims to create a dynamic, evolving data warehouse specifically designed for marketing datasets, with a focus on:
- Building a flexible, scalable database
- Tracking datasets for global marketing purposes
- Supporting both human and non-human marketing data
- Enabling continuous self-improvement

## Key Project Requirements
1. **Database Infrastructure**
   - Create a server-based database
   - Develop using small, modular sub-modules
   - Ensure scalability and extensibility

2. **Data Collection and Management**
   - Initial focus on simple datasets
   - Gradual evolution to more complex data structures
   - Support for diverse marketing-related information

3. **Continuous Improvement Mechanism**
   - Ongoing connection to AI tools
   - Regular updates to project progress tracking
   - Automatic continuation of project development

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Project Initialization
- Create a GitHub repository at https://github.com/QuantSetter/Peso
- Set up initial project structure
- Develop 'Project Progress Ongoing Updates Document'

### 2. Database Sub-Modules
- Design modular database components
- Implement each sub-module incrementally
- Ensure each module can be independently updated

### 3. Data Collection Framework
- Develop mechanisms for:
  * Public data aggregation
  * Non-human marketing data collection
  * Data validation and cleaning
  * Scalable storage solutions

### 4. AI Integration
- Create interfaces to connect with various AI tools
- Implement update mechanisms
- Develop protocols for automatic data enrichment

### 5. Continuous Progress Tracking
- Maintain a living project document
- Track completed and pending sub-modules
- Implement self-updating progress tracking

## Technical Considerations
- Full-stack software engineering approach
- Data warehouse specialization
- Emphasis on efficiency and modularity
- Ability to evolve autonomously

## Next Steps
1. Set up initial GitHub repository
2. Create first sub-module for database infrastructure
3. Develop initial project progress tracking document
4. Begin data collection framework design
